> NET is a website where users can track their income and expenses, save the relative documents, and access their overall statistics

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to import or export my data, so that I can store them elsewhere
- As a user, I want to browse my transactions, so that I can edit or add to them supporting documents
- As a user, I want to opt in or out from being publicly visible, so that my stats are kept private

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack NET uses:

- This project uses the React javascript library to power it's user interface, and the Express library to power it's API's 
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses mongoDB and the mongoose package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- This project was deployed using docker compose with seperate containers 
- The design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
