> NET is a website where users can track their income and expenses, save the relative documents, and access their overall statistics

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to import or export my data, so that I can store them elsewhere
- As a user, I want to browse my transactions, so that I can edit or add to them supporting documents
- As a user, I want to opt in or out from being publicly visible, so that my stats are kept private

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack NET uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
